1:
The unit was taken apart and the hole for the cable was drilled out to accept a three-core replica vintage cable. The brass plate had an earth cable soldered to it on the inside and then the outside was polished. All the wood was cleaned and hand-made bees wax applied then polished.

2:
A Lilley B22 bayonet cap brass safer switched lamp holder 1/2" entry was used and earthed.

3:
Self-adhesive red felt used on the bottom.
